# MCTS-LLM

**An example combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and LLMs for self-improvement through critique and refinement.**

This script wraps an LLM with a basic search algorithm designed to iteratively improve an initial answer to a question. At each step, the LLM critiques its previous response and attempts to improve it, with the MCTS algorithm driving exploration and backpropagation of quality signals. The goal is to converge on a better answer than the vanilla model output.

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates:

- Use of **seed answers** to initialise a search tree
- An LLM used in three modes:
  - **Critique**: highlight flaws in a draft
  - **Improve**: rewrite the draft using the critique
  - **Evaluate**: score the final answer numerically
- MCTS with UCT for decision-making over answer revisions
- Logging and structure suitable for extension or adaptation

## Method

The process is as follows:

1. **Seed**: Start with a basic or uncertain answer (`"I'm not sure"` etc.)
2. **Iterate**: For a fixed number of iterations:
   - Select a promising node based on UCT
   - Critique the current answer
   - Generate an improved answer
   - Evaluate the result with a rating prompt
   - Backpropagate the score to update the tree
3. **Select**: Return the highest-value child after search

## Example Usage

```bash
python mcts_llm.py
```

Critique: Okay, let's critique the draft answer.

**Question:** A man and a goat are on one side of a river. They have a boat. How can they go across?

**Critique of Draft Answer: "I'm not sure"**

* **What's wrong:** The answer "I'm not sure" is insufficient. It doesn't demonstrate any attempt to solve the problem.
* **What could be improved:** Explore possible scenarios. Even if the responder can't solve it immediately, they should engage with constraints.
* **Logical Fallacies:** None directly, but lacks reasoning.

**Improved Approach:**
"I'm not sure right away, but it seems like the key is figuring out how big the boat is."

**Option 1:**
"I'm not sure immediately. I need to know how big the boat is..."

**Option 2:**
"Hmm, this sounds like a riddle. The man will probably have to make multiple trips..."

**Option 3:**
"The man could row the goat across, then row back alone..."

**Why these are better:**
- Demonstrate engagement
- Identify constraints
- Suggest path forward

Critique: Here's a critique and breakdown.

**Problem:** Avoids problem instead of solving it. Too short. No reasoning.

**Understanding the Problem:**
1. Classic river-crossing puzzle.
2. Logical Fallacies: Potential cognitive ease and framing bias.

**Improved Approach:**
"Letâ€™s assume the boat only holds one â€” man or goat. That shapes the solution."

**Improved Answer:**
"1. The man takes the goat across.  
  2. He returns alone.  
  3. He takes the goat again."

**Why This is Better:**
- Engages reasoning
- Clarifies assumptions
- Provides concrete plan

Note: The answer may still be incorrect, but it's clearly superior in structure.

Critique: Letâ€™s critique again.

**Original:** "I'm not sure"

**Problem:** No effort or reasoning. Doesnâ€™t explain or explore alternatives.

**Fallacies:** Appeal to ignorance

**Example Better Answer:**
"The man can row the goat across. That solves the problem."

**Alternative (small boat):**
Same logic applied with constraints.

**Final Improved Answer:**  
The man rows the goat across the river in the boat.

Vanilla Score Prompt â†’  
The solution is incomplete. It ignores typical constraints (e.g. leaving the goat unattended).  
Could be valid in trivial cases, but misleading in context.
